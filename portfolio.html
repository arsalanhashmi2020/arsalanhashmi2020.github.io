        <div id="introduction">
            I am currently enrolled as a student in LUMS University.
            With a keen interest in how information propagates around systems
            until it becomes ubiquitious, I am inclined towards statistics,
            machine-learning, neural networks and graph theory.
            <br><br>
            I am also interested in existential philosophy because this world
            does not make sense to me and yet I exist in it. To fight this chaos,
            I look toward structure and toward coexistence through the communication
            of truth through action.
